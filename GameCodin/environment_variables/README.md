# Environment variables

In order to get the project up and running, you will need to:
1. copy the `example.env` file in this directory;
2. rename the copied `example.env` to `.env`;
3. give each of the environment variables (in the `.env` file) a value.


### Contributions

If you add an environment variable locally to your `.env`, don't forget to add it to the `example.env`.
